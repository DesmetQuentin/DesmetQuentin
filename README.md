- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DesmetQuentin
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m working on coupling SYMPHONIE (local oceanic model from LEGOS, Toulouse, France)
                        with RegCM (atmospheric model developped at ICTP, Trieste, Italy)
                     through OASIS3-MCT (coupler module developped at CERFACS, Toulouse, France)
         in order to study air-sea interaction contributions in the Southeast Asian climate.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently in PhD at LEGOS, Toulouse, France, and supervised by Marine Herrmann (LEGOS, France)
                                                                    and Thanh Ngo-Duc (USTH, Vietnam).
     I'm also quite in contact with Fabien Solmon (LAERO, France)
                                and Patrick Marsaleix (LEGOS, France)
         for conducting this work.
